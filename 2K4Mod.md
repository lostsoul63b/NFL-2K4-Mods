### Why would I play this when 2K5 exists?
NFL 2K4 is very similar to 2K5 and features a stellar run game. Some issues that plague 2K5 are not present in 2K4. It runs exceptionally well on Xbox and it’s another, fully updated football option.

### Are the rosters updated?
Thanks to GillBoldberg, yes, they are . They are included in this release. Player portraits and cyberfaces are not available at this time. I would actually encourage the community to not focus on this, as it will probably lead to wasted effort. We need to assign portraits in a smart way first, before venturing into replacements.

### Is this the same as NFL 2K23 AKA NFL 2K5 Resurrected?
In some ways, yes, in others no. RateSports personally created thousands of textures for this release, including all jerseys, helmets, socks, fonts, menus and much more. The remaining textures have been ported from NFL 2K23 by himself and members of the mod team.

### How does this perform on Xbox Series X|S?
Extremely, extremely well. Crashing is much less frequent, so this is 100% the preferred game for console players.

PC update is being compiled and will be available soon.

This mod has been months and months of heads down work and brings an entirely new level of authenticity. The size of this is more than double that of NFL 4K23 and you’ll see why when you boot up. 

Enormous Uniform Selections
For the first time, enjoy using hundreds of uniform combos without the need to activate them prior to starting your game. Cycle through your unis, check out the 3D preview and load into the game wearing the threads you want. 

Updated Textures & Color Palettes
Since 4K23, I’ve improved the uniform template that I use and have applied it to every uniform in the game. 

UI Improvements
I’ve improved as much as I can with texture replacement here, creating 4K24 graphic backgrounds, new team select helmets, 3D uniform previews, improved thumbnails for stadium selection, and have overhauled every font in the game. 

Updated Rosters
This is ENTIRELY because of @GillBoldberg and his hard work. This dude is a champion and deserves the ultimate recognition. The 4K24 R0 roster included here is his roster. 

As always, shoutout to @LostsouL and @CujoMatty for being the best teammates here. 

We have more exciting stuff to share in the future, but enjoy this new release!) | [Add-on](https://www.mediafire.com/file_premium/a87t19zw0i6gr2q/NFL_4K24_R0_Game_Mod_Add-on.zip/file) | [Tutorial]() |
