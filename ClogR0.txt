NFL 4K24 Release Zero, the newest mod for ESPN NFL Football, is now available to download for Xbox Series X|S! PC update is being compiled and will be available soon.

This mod has been months and months of heads down work and brings an entirely new level of authenticity. The size of this is more than double that of NFL 4K23 and you’ll see why when you boot up. 

Enormous Uniform Selections
For the first time, enjoy using hundreds of uniform combos without the need to activate them prior to starting your game. Cycle through your unis, check out the 3D preview and load into the game wearing the threads you want. 

Updated Textures & Color Palettes
Since 4K23, I’ve improved the uniform template that I use and have applied it to every uniform in the game. 

UI Improvements
I’ve improved as much as I can with texture replacement here, creating 4K24 graphic backgrounds, new team select helmets, 3D uniform previews, improved thumbnails for stadium selection, and have overhauled every font in the game. 

Updated Rosters
This is ENTIRELY because of @GillBoldberg and his hard work. This dude is a champion and deserves the ultimate recognition. The 4K24 R0 roster included here is his roster. 

As always, shoutout to @LostsouL and @CujoMatty for being the best teammates here. 

We have more exciting stuff to share in the future, but enjoy this new release!
